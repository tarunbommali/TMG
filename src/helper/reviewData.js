      "My car had an issue with the AC. I visited the company service center, where I was informed that car's AC is not cooling at optimum level. The showroom workers came back advising it to be a faulty compressor and they need to replace it, which would cost around 15000 Rupees. After consulting with my friends and researching online, I took my car to GoMechanic, The workers were kind and skillful, overall providing the best value for money repairs.",

Not only did they repair my car in a short span of time, but gave a comprehensive look on all the working parts to find any shortcomings which would prevent any mishap as I was going on a long drive. This type of top-notch repair service is hard to find nowadays. As always, GoMechanic is on the top of everything. Much recommended!",

    review: "Chose GoMechanic for my first car repair outside the official dealer service center. I was a bit skeptical at first but after researching online for the best car repair near me, I went for GoMechanic. They deliver the best quality repair service in town and with free pick-up and drop facility. Nothing to complain about, hence, I will continue to get my car repaired here as these guys did a wonderful job, also were fast & accurate in doing so.",
