    review:
      "My car had an issue with the AC. I visited the company service center, where I was informed that car's AC is not cooling at optimum level. The showroom workers came back advising it to be a faulty compressor and they need to replace it, which would cost around 15000 Rupees. After consulting with my friends and researching online, I took my car to GoMechanic and they did the required repair work at a much lower price. The workers were kind and skillful, overall providing the best value for money repairs.",
